# Space Engineers Scripts
Version control for scripts released to the Steam Workshop

Space Engineers programmable blocks have a character limit of 100,000 glyphs. To fit fit within that limit, scripts are often minified.  This repository serves both as version control and as a "source-of-the-source", containing pre-minified versions of scripts published to the Steam Workshop.
